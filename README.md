# Tracking-empoyees
This is Homework 12 using node.js, inquirer, and MySql to make an Employee Tracker. This Employee Tracker uses an interface that allows the user to input  information from the command line and enter input and then store that info and generate a database.

I have taken the opportunity to add a removeRole function to the switch statement in order for me to learn how to remove columns from the database, it gave me some errors (pains), but I was finally able to solve it and I think once I am finished with the boot camp that I will add a remove function to every choice, because departments, roles, employees and such can change and the user should have more options to reflect that change.
Here is the link to my video of me interacting with this app.
